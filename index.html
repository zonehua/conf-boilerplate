            <td class="schedule-description">In 5G networks, traffics from vertical markets (smart city, smart grid, smart cars, eHealth, etc.) are expected to converge on the IP network segments, from mobile to access to core networks. The heterogeneity of traffic and services induce cybersecurity challenges, mainly isolation ones. Network slicing enables the creation of virtual networks on top of the unified network resources across domains. As experiments are run around the world in order to accelerate its definition and implementation, we strive to design and evaluate its security. In particular, our works encompass a number of topics, securing the mapping between virtual resources to physical resources (or virtual network embedding) to optimizing the instantiation and allocation of network monitoring and security functions in the physical network. Such network virtualization usually leverages software-defined control and network function virtualization, but also graph-based and machine-learning approaches.</td>

            <td class="schedule-description">Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are a promising platform to develop innovative network security services. However, current approaches to operate SDN-based security remain mostly provider-centric. They enable operators to specify security services, and to leverage standard SDN implementations such as OpenFlow, in order to deploy end-to-end policies including, for example, network isolation, monitoring, and incident handling. A common limitation to these approaches is their inability to specify custom, user-centric, security requirements. Users on top of the SDN controller may need to compose specific security services and to operate user-specific security policies. Unfortunately, in today’s provider-centric SDN networks, security remains mostly beyond the users’ reach, which may lead to security loopholes, yet also vendor lock-ins. This talk introduces a security management framework that is integrated to the SDN control plane. This framework enables the tenants of an SDN network to design and operate their own security monitoring contexts and policies. The framework monitors on the fly the user-defined contexts, and tunes the security policies accordingly. It further optimizes the deployment of these policies through the dynamic composition and chaining of network security services, while also reducing the cost and overhead to the operator.</td>

            <td class="schedule-description">With the emergence of Software Defined Networks (SDN), new virtualization techniques have appeared (e.g. FlowVisor). Traditional hypervision has attracted a lot of attention with respect to resource sharing and multi-tenancy.Cloud providers have usually a solid knowledge on how to manage computing, memory and storage resources, but often lack the ability to properly manage network resources. Thanks to OpenFlow, virtualizing the network infrastructure has become more accessible and eased, with a unified southbond interface. However, network virtualization also comes with its own security issues on operations. In this presentation, we focus on the security aspects related to the migration of virtual networks.</td>

            <td class="schedule-description">The rapid adoption of the Internet of Thing (IoT) introduces new security challenges. Most of the IoT devices are vulnerable because of the lack of security experience of the manufacturers and the short time to market. Mirai botnet illustrates the threat posed by IoT devices. In this context, Machine Learning techniques can be leveraged to detect attacks in IoT networks. Indeed, contrary to desktop computers or laptops, IoT devices are very purpose specific. Therefore, network traffic is very predictable making data analysis techniques well suited to detect a deviation from the expected behavior. In our work, we apply machine learning algorithms to detect infected devices in a smart home network. To this purposes a small experimental smart home network is enabled to generate realistic network traffic data.The obtained dataset will help to model the expected behavior of the smart home network. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify the traffic and to detect unusual activities.</td>
